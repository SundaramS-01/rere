# rereA young boy studying mechanical engineering picks up his interest in machine learning. Then he goes to Kaggle to practice ML skills for days and nights, achieves good rank and gets hired directly as a data scientist after finishing his b tech mechanical. He doesn't have any formal education or degree in computer science or data science.
The reason for writing this post is I want to tell everyone that you don't need a comp science or data science college degree in order to build a career in data science, AI.
This person's name is Tanul Singh and I recently interviewed him on my channel. We discussed how platforms like Kaggle can help in building data science career. https://lnkd.in/evaCM3F
